  - Star formation history
  - Spiral in M81
  - Density Wave
  
summary: Using the color-magnitude diagram of M81 constructed from HST imaging, I measured spatially resolved star formation histories around the spiral arm in M81. We test the density wave theory by looking for the predicted star formation propagation across the spiral arm.
