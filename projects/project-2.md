summary: Our team developed the Bayesian Extinction and Stellar Tool (BEAST). The BEAST fits the ultraviolet to near-infrared photometric SEDs of stars to extract stellar and dust extinction parameters.

(This page is currently in active development!)

The BEAST is the stellar SED fitting tool that I have been contributing to develop and improve since 2014. The full details of the BEAST are provided by [Gordon et al. 2016](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016ApJ...826..104G).

I have specifically used the BEAST to measure the line-of-sight dust extinction and to infer the intrinsic ionizing photons from individual stars in a galaxy NGC 4214, a nearby starburst galaxy as an excellent analog of high-z star-forming dwarf galaxies.
