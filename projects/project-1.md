The Survey of the Magellanic Stellar History (SMASH) maps ~480 square degrees of the sky to depths of ugriz~24 to detect stellar populations associated with the Magellanic Clouds. The observation and data reduction completed, and our team had the first data release for ~100 million objects in 2017. The data is available through [NOAO DataLab](https://datalab.noao.edu/smash/smash.php). The detailed description of the survey can be found in [Nidever et al. 2017](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017AJ....154..199N).  

Vacay is implemented using [Meteor](http://meteor.com), a JavaScript application platform. Within two weeks, we created a website that implements several types of reservations including flights, hotels, and car rentals.

In this project I gained experience with full-stack web application design and associated technologies, including [MongoDB](http://mongodb.com) for database storage, the [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) CSS Framework for the user interface, and Javascript for both client and server-side programming.
